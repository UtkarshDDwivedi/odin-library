# odin-library

This project was somehow harder than I thought, especially the display and removal of books, as my knowledge of forms was rusty. I didn't knew how to access data submitted through form in javascirpt so had to figure it out. Anyways rest, it was a fun little project. 
Thanks for checking it out ðŸ¤ž
